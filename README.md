## Virtual_Server_Management

Short summary of the text: There are a large number of unused resources on the existing servers or only a fraction of the resources are needed. These server were visualised as virtual servers. The inventory was done with the data CPU, bandwidth, RAM. New servers are now to be purchased. An offer is received for this. Your task is now to find out how many new servers need to be purchased using the first fit algorithm. Each virtual machine is to be placed on the existing servers. If the existing resources are not sufficient, another server is to be purchased. The resulting algorithm is to be addressed and tested by means of unit testing.

Time for coding: approx. 1h

Usecase: Buy new servers for hosting own virtual servers

Solution: Use brute force for approx. number of servers. (Predefined)
